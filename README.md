# MomentJS Age Clock
An exercise in reading the MomentJS documentation to accompany a documentation lecture

## High Level Goal for this Activity
The goal of this activity is for you to put in to practice the principles of effectively navigating documentation that were outlined in the slides. As this is an exercise in documentation reading, please rely primarily on documentation and only secondarily on Stack Overflow

You will use MomentJS and a MomentJS plugin to make an exact age clock. Your finished product will look something like this:

## Bare Minimum Requirements

2. Utilize the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [moment-precise-range plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-precise-range) documentation. **Use Stack Overflow as a BACKUP and not a default**.

## Getting Started

2. You should not need to edit any files other than index.html
